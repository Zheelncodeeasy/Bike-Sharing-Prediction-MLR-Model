# Bike Sharing Prediction MLR Model
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
> The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- Using a multiple linear regression model, we aim to help BoomBikes identify the key predictors that could increase their revenue and enhance their business among customers.
- BoomBikes, a USA-based company, experienced a dip in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic and wants to understand the various factors contributing to this decline. By applying a multiple linear regression model to the dataset, we will predict the bike rental count using several key features.
- For this analysis, we are using the bike sharing dataset provided by the company, specifically the file day.csv.

## Conclusions
- Univariate Analysis -
  Categorical columns
    In the fall season, the highest number of bike rentals is 188, compared to other seasons.
    We can observe that for both years 2018 and 2019, the number of bike rentals are same.
    As per the data, alternate months starting from January show an increase in the number of bike rentals. However, in July and August, the number of bike rentals remains the same. The lowest bike rentals   
    occurred in February.
    709 bike rentals were done on a working day as compared to holidays.
    Almost all weekdays have same number of bike rentals.
    A total of 499 bike rentals occurred on working days rather than holidays or weekends.
    The highest number of bike rentals occurred during clear weather conditions.
  Numerical columns
    The highest number of bike rentals occurred when the temperature was between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius.
    The highest number of bike rentals also occurred when the feels-like temperature (apparent temperature) was between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius.
    According to the data, bike rentals peaked when the humidity level was around 60%.
    The highest number of bike rentals occurred when the wind speed was between 10 and 15 km/h.
    The majority of total bike rental counts fell between 4000 and 6000.
